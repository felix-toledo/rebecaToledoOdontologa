<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](./media/readme_images/screenshoot_desktop.jpg)


This is my first project I'm doing full vanilla with HTML, SCSS, BOOSTRAP. 

Context:
I started a full-stack learning path and this is my first page I'm doing with the "web design" course.
I decided to make the project for my Sister because she needed a webpage for his job and also It would be good for her having one to improve her "digital" presence.
